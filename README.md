This repository serves as the data reduction process for SDFITS files provided to the **Skynet Robotic Telescope Network**. The pipeline is designed to handle radio tracking, ON/OFF, and mapping files. While integrated into Skynet, access to regularly scheduled calibration observations allows for all returned data to be flux calibrated into Janskys (Jy). The pipeline supports radio astronomy for students, educators, and astronomers!

## Validation

Validation is the first stage of the pipeline. This stage ensures that data is physical and maintains the integrity of the file. It employs a Python-based pipeline to check data types for proper formatting. It ensures there are no nonphysical value (e.g. negative temperatures in Kelvin). Validation also confirms that timestamps are valid for the associated data and that no NaN values exist.


## Atmosphere Correction

Skynet employs radio telescopes across the globe with L-, S-, C-, X-, Ku-, and K-band receivers. L-, S-, and C-bands are not dramatically attenuated by the atmosphere, but X-, Ku-, and K-bands suffer significant transmission loss due to water vapor and oxygen absorption lines. The K-band contains a notable water vapor absorption line centered within its frequency range causing the most transmission loss among radio bands. The model uses Buck equations for approximating saturation vapor pressure and ITU-R suggestions for slant path attenuations.


## Continuum

Continuum creates a gain calibrated and flux calibrated observation. The continuum is generated by integrating along the frequency axis of the data cube contained in the SDFITS file. Gain calibration ses pre- and post-calibration spikes in the observation to place the data into calibration units. This is then followed by flux calibration which uses scheduled calibration observations of sources like Virgo A, Taurus A, and Cygnus A to convert calibration units to Jy. The calibration techniques employ robust outlier reject methods and statistical modeling to ensure precision.


## Spectrum

Spectrum creates a spectrum for the expected frequency range while also handling ON/OFF files when relevant. The spectrum is generated by integrating along the time axis of the data cube contained in the SDFITS file. The spectrum supports **ON/OFF mode** to retrieve true source signal; removing receiver noise and background.
